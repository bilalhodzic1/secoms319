                  <p class="card-text">
                    The Arleigh Burke class of guided-missile destroyers (DDGs)
                    is a United States Navy class of destroyer centered around
                    the Aegis Combat System and the SPY-1D multi-function
                    passive electronically scanned array radar. The class is
                    named for Admiral Arleigh Burke, an American destroyer
                    officer in World War II and later Chief of Naval Operations.
                    With an overall length of 505 to 509.5 feet (153.9 to 155.3
                    m), displacement ranging from 8,300 to 9,700 tons, and
                    weaponry including over 90 missiles, the Arleigh Burke-class
                    destroyers are larger and more heavily armed than many
                    previous classes of guided-missile cruisers. Buy yours now

                    The M1 Abrams is a third-generation American main battle
                    tank designed by Chrysler Defense (now General Dynamics Land
                    Systems) and named for General Creighton Abrams. Conceived
                    for modern armored ground warfare and now one of the
                    heaviest tanks in service at nearly 68 short tons (62 metric
                    tons), it introduced several modern technologies to US
                    armored forces, including a multifuel turbine engine,
                    sophisticated Chobham composite armor, a computer fire
                    control system, separate ammunition storage in a blow-out
                    compartment, and NBC protection for crew safety. Initial
                    models of the M1 were armed with a licensed-produced 105 mm
                    Royal Ordnance L7 gun, while later variants feature a
                    licensed Rheinmetall 120 mm L/44. Buy yours now through

                    The Cougar is a mine-resistant ambush-protected (MRAP) and
                    infantry mobility vehicle structured to be resistant to
                    landmines and improvised munitions. It is a family of
                    armored vehicles produced by Force Protection Inc, which
                    manufactures ballistic and mine-protected vehicles. These
                    vehicles are protected against small arms, land mines and
                    improvised explosive devices (IEDs) using a combination of
                    design features and materials to protect both the crew and
                    engine compartment against a wide range of attacks. A
                    Monocoque type, V-shaped hull extends to the engine bay and
                    serves to direct the blast away from under the vehicle. The
                    dual air-conditioners help keep heavily dressed troops from
                    overheating in temperatures over 100 °F (38 °C) in Iraq. Buy

                    System (UTTAS) competition in 1972. The Army designated the
                    prototype as the YUH-60A and selected the Black Hawk as the
                    winner of the program in 1976, after a fly-off competition

                    The General Atomics MQ-9 Reaper (sometimes called Predator
                    B) is an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) capable of remotely
                    controlled or autonomous flight operations developed by
                    General Atomics Aeronautical Systems (GA-ASI) primarily for
                    the United States Air Force (USAF). The MQ-9 and other UAVs
                    are referred to as Remotely Piloted Vehicles/Aircraft
                    (RPV/RPA) by the USAF to indicate their human ground
                    controllers. The MQ-9 is the first hunter-killer UAV
                    designed for long-endurance, high-altitude surveillance. In
                    2006, the then–Chief of Staff of the United States Air Force
                    General T. Michael Moseley said: "We've moved from using
                    UAVs primarily in intelligence, surveillance, and
                    reconnaissance roles before Operation Iraqi Freedom, to a
                    true hunter-killer role with the Reaper. Buy yours now
