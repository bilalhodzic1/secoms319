                  <p class="card-text">
                    The M2 flamethrower was an American, man-portable, backpack
                    flamethrower that was used in World War II, the Korean War,
                    and the Vietnam War. The M2 was the successor to the M1 and
                    M1A1 flamethrowers. Although its burn time was around 7
                    seconds long, and the flames were effective around 20-40
                    meters, it was still a useful weapon. With the arrival of
                    flamethrower tanks, the need for flamethrower-carrying
                    infantrymen to expose themselves to enemy fire had been
                    greatly reduced. Buy yours now through Saya's Armory!<br />

                  <p class="card-text">
                    The M2 machine gun or Browning .50 caliber machine gun is a
                    heavy machine gun that was designed near the end of World
                    War I by John Browning. While similar to Browning's earlier
                    M1919 Browning machine gun, which was chambered for the
                    .30-06 cartridge, the M2 uses Browning's larger and more
                    powerful .50 BMG (12.7 mm) cartridge. The design has had
                    many designations; the official U.S. military designation
                    for the current infantry type is Browning Machine Gun, Cal.
                    .50, M2, HB, Flexible. It is effective against infantry,
                    unarmored or lightly armored vehicles and boats, light
                    fortifications, and low-flying aircraft. Buy yours now

                  <p class="card-text">
                    The M16 rifle (officially designated Rifle, Caliber 5.56 mm,
                    M16) is a family of military rifles adapted from the
                    ArmaLite AR-15 rifle for the United States military. The
                    original M16 rifle was a 5.56×45mm automatic rifle with a
                    20-round magazine. In 1964, the M16 entered US military
                    service and the following year was deployed for jungle
                    warfare operations during the Vietnam War. In 1969, the
                    M16A1 replaced the M14 rifle to become the US military's
                    standard service rifle. The M16A1 incorporated numerous
                    modifications including a bolt-assist, chrome-plated bore,
                    protective reinforcement around the magazine release, and
                    revised flash hider. Buy yours now through Saya's Armory!

                  <p class="card-text">
                    The M1 Garand or M1 rifle is a semi-automatic rifle that was
                    the service rifle of the U.S. Army during World War II and
                    the Korean War.<br />

                    The rifle is chambered for the .30-06 Springfield cartridge
                    and is named after its Canadian-American designer, John
                    Garand. It was the first standard-issue autoloading rifle
                    for the United States. By most accounts, the M1 rifle
                    performed well. General George S. Patton called it "the
                    greatest battle implement ever devised". The M1 replaced the
                    bolt-action M1903 Springfield as the U.S.' service rifle in
                    1936, and was itself replaced by the selective-fire M14
                    rifle on March 26, 1958. Buy yours now through Saya's

                  <p class="card-text">
                    The M4 bayonet, like the M3 fighting knife that preceded it,
                    was designed for rapid production using a minimum of
                    strategic metals and machine processes, it used a relatively
                    narrow 6.75-inch bayonet-style spear-point blade with a
                    sharpened 3.5-inch secondary edge. The blade was made of
                    carbon steel, and was either blued or parkerized. Production
                    of the grooved wooden handle was later simplified by forming
                    the grip of stacked leather washers that were shaped by
                    turning on a lathe, then polished and lacquered. The steel
                    crossguard had a bayonet muzzle ring and the bayonet
                    fastener is on the pommel. Later models used a black molded
                    plastic handle. The basic design would be used for the later
                    M5, M6 and M7 bayonets. Buy yours now through Saya's Armory!

                  <p class="card-text">
                    The M1903 Springfield, officially the United States Rifle,
                    Caliber .30-06, Model 1903, is an American five-round
                    magazine-fed, bolt-action service repeating rifle, used
                    primarily during the first half of the 20th century. The
                    M1903 was first used in combat during the
                    Philippine–American War, and it was officially adopted by
                    the United States as the standard infantry rifle on June 19,
                    1903, where it saw service in World War I, and was replaced
                    by the faster-firing semi-automatic eight-round M1 Garand
                    starting in 1936. However, the M1903 remained in service as
                    a standard issue infantry rifle during World War II, since
                    the U.S. entered the war without sufficient M1 rifles to arm
                    all troops. It also remained in service as a sniper rifle
                    during World War II, the Korean War, and the Vietnam War. It
                    remains popular as a civilian firearm, historical
                    collector's piece, a competitive shooting rifle, and as a
                    military drill rifle. Buy yours now through Saya's Armory!
